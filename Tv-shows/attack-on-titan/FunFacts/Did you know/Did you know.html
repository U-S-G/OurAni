            written by Hajime Isayama himself and published in the Japanese magazine Brutus.</p><br>

        <h2>Attack on Titan blacklisted?</h2>
        <img src="blacklisted.jpg">

        <h2>Favourite character</h2>
        <img src="Fav character.jpg">
        <p> Hajime Isyama’s favorite character is Jean Kirschtein. 
            Cause Isayma admires how Jean says what he wants without worrying about what other people think. But it was all in the past.</p><br>

        <h2>coincidence? i think not</h2>
        <img src="half.jpg">
        <p>Marco’s birthday is on June 16th, Which is exactly halfway through the year. 
            This takes a whole new meaning when you find that half of his body is found. 
            Maybe if he would’ve born in January, he would have died in a better way.</p><br>

        <h2>hmm...</h2>
        <img src="MoF.jfif">
        <p>Hange is shown as a female in both anime and live-action film. But things aren’t so clear in the manga. 
            Regarding this issue, Isayama has said that it is up to the readers to decide because he thinks “Either one is fine”.</p><br>

        <h2>Freedom</h2>
        <img src="free.jpg">
        <p>Eren’s desire to go outside the walls stems from Isayama’s childhood. 
            He grew in a village surrounded by mountains, and always wanted to see what was beyond them. 
            The area surrounding walls was inspired by Isayama’s village.</p><br>

        <h2>Save the potatoes</h2>
        <img src="sasha.jpg">
        <p>An Interview with Isayama’s editor revealed that everyone’s favorite potato girl, Sasha, was set to be killed off in manga chapter 36.

        <h2>Death to all</h2>
        <img src="deattoall.jpg">
        <p>Isayama originally planned to give the series a tragic conclusion, where every character dies. 
            However, positive response to the manga and anime has caused the author to consider changing the ending due to the impact it could have on fans.</p><br>

        <h2>.....</h2>
        <img src="fear.jpg">
        <p>Before becoming Mangaka, Isayama worked at an Internet Cafe. 
            While working at an internet cafe, Isayama encountered a customer who grabbed him by the collar. 
            It was this incident that showed him “the fear of meeting a person I can’t communicate with”, which is the feeling that he conveys through the Titans. 
            Thus he created the scary Titans.</p><br>
