                Humakind are nearly exterminated by giant creatures called Titans.
                Titans are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, 
                seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source.
                A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a land protected by extremely high walls,
                even taller than the biggest of titans.Flash forward to the present, and mankind has not seen a titan in over 100 years.
                One day, 10 year old Eren and his childhood friend Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a

                    In this fictional world set in early 20th century Taishō-era Japan, man-eating demons roam the land each night. 
                    13-year-old Tanjiro Kamado’s world is turned upside down when he returns home one morning to find his entire family 
                    murdered save for his sister Nezuko—who has turned into a demon. Determined to avenge their deaths and find a cure that would 
                    transform Nezuko back into a human, Tanjiro sets out on a journey to train for the Demon Slayer Corps.
                    The story follows him as he joins this underground organization of skilled fighters who dedicate their lives to protecting humans 
                    from the vicious creatures.

                    The world is one ravaged by Devils, otherworldly monsters who feed on human fear. 
                    Despite their antagonistic nature, humans can actually form alliances with these Devils and gain powers of their own. 
                    The protagonist, a downtrodden young man named Denji, works to clear his father's massive debt to the yakuza. 
                    Aiding him on this journey is Pochita, a Devil in disguise as a dog, who has a chainsaw for a nose.
