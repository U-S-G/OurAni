                in silence in order to restrain the urge of eating other humans<br><br>

              <h2>Nezuko could always walk in the sun</h2><img src="images/burnnezu.jpg" alt="nezuko geting burned" class="mini2"><br>Many fans belive that nezuko could 
              always walk in the sun because some belive that as children nezuko and kamado were belived to have drank the blue lily as kids, while others belive that the Reason
              she survived was because of her family's connection to the hinokami kagura(sun breathing).<br><br>
                 
              <h2>Inosuke and His Pig Head</h2><img src="images/inosuke.jpg" alt="Inosuke" class="mini3"><br>Inosuke is a character that can be easily recognized by 
              the pig head that he wears all the time. He has a sad story about growing up with boars and lacking social skills.Inosuke’s mother, while fleeing her
               abusive husband, takes refuge in a cult that, unbeknownst to her, was run by the demon Doma and gets killed by him. Consequently, Boars raises the 
               infant Inosuke, and he wears the hollowed-out head of his boar mother to honor her memory.<br><br>

              <h2>Tanjiro’s scare</h2><img src="images/tanjiro.webp" alt="Tanjiro" class="mini4"><br>The scar on Tanjiro’s forehead was a minor burn when he saved his little brother from getting burned. 
              When Tanjiro grows strong, the scar changes into the shape of a mark. The mark awakens when Tanjiro is in danger and when the Sun Breathing technique
               is in use. The scar on his forehead refers to Demon Slayer Mark, a tattoo-like mark or birthmark that grants the bearer incredible power and links 
               directly to the Sun Breathing technique. The power-up makes the bearer at the same level as the Twelve Kizuki.</div>
