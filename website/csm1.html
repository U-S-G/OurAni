                    <p> The world is one ravaged by Devils, otherworldly monsters who feed on human fear. 
                      Despite their antagonistic nature, humans can actually form alliances with these Devils and gain powers of their own. 
                      The protagonist, a downtrodden young man named Denji, works to clear his father's massive debt to the yakuza. 
                      Aiding him on this journey is Pochita, a Devil in disguise as a dog, who has a chainsaw for a nose.

              <div class="theory">
                <li><h2>The Mystery Of The Fake Chainsaw Man</h2></li><img src="images/Fake_Chainsaw_Man_29.webp" class="mini1" alt="Fake-chainsaw man"><br> One of the most debated topics among fans is the 
                identity of the fake Chainsaw Man that killed Yuko. Some believe that Haruka Iseumi, a die-hard Chainsaw Man enthusiast, might be the imposter.
                 His obsession went so far that he even got a surgically implanted ripcord to resemble Chainsaw Man.<br><br>

              <li><h2>Yoshida: The Death Devil</h2></li><img src="images/yoshida.jpg" alt="yoshida" class="mini2"><br> 
               Hirofumi Yoshida has been a character shrouded in mystery. Some fans speculate that he might be the Death Devil,
               one of the Four Horsemen. Others believe he might have a contract with the Death Devil. His cryptic lines in Part 2, 
               especially his question to Denji about why he doesn’t “eat death,” further fuel this theory.<br><br>
              
               <li><h2>Fami And Yoshida’s Connection</h2></li><img src="images/fami+yoshida.jpg" alt="fami and yoshida's stare down" class="mini3"><br>
               Given a particular scene where Fami looks at Yoshida, fans are speculating a deeper connection between the two. Since Fami is one
               of the Four Horsemen, it’s believed that Yoshida might have ties with them, further supporting the Death Devil theory.<br><br>

              <li><h2>Denji And Asa’s Romantic Development</h2></li><img src="images/asa+denji.webp" alt="Asa and denji" class="mini4"><br>While not a theory about the plot’s direction, 
               fans are eagerly discussing the potential romantic development between Denji and Asa. Their moments together have left fans excited and hopeful for more in the
               upcoming season.
