                    <p>Humans are nearly exterminated by giant creatures called Titans. 
                        Titans are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do 
                        it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a land 
                        protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest of titans. Flash forward to the present, and mankind has not 
                        seen a titan in over 100 years. One day, 10 year old Eren and his childhood friend Mikasa witness something horrific as the city 
                        walls are destroyed by a colossal titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller titans flood the city, the two kids watch in 
                        horror as Eren's mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder every single titan and take revenge for all of mankind.

              <div class="theory">
                <li><h2>Armin Is The Narrator Of The Story</h2></li><img src="images/armin.jfif" class="mini1" alt="armin arlert"><br> Marina Inoue and Josh Grelle are the Japanese and English voice actors of Armin Arlert.
                 The narrator of the show is voiced by the same pair that does Armin's Japanese and English voice. This fact made fans belive that 
                 an older version of Armin is retelling the story, recalling all the tragic events that the viewrs are currently watching.<br><br>

              <li><h2>Historia's Child Is The New Beast Titan</h2></li><img src="images/historia.jpg" alt="Historia" class="mini2"><br> when a titan shifter dies without tranfereing thier powers, a newborn Eldian will be the one to inherites
              that titans shifters powers and seeing how zeke died without transfereing his powers, it has been speculated that Historia's new child is the new beast titan.<br><br>
              
              <li><h2>Titans Are Trying Revert Back To Humans</h2></li><img src="images/titans.jfif" alt="man eating titans" class="mini3"><br>Fans know that titans only have one goal and thats to eat humans, but it was also shown that titans dont need
              to eat humans inoder to survive. This lead some fans to belive that titans eating humans is then trying to turn back into humans. this general speculation amoungs fans 
              says that titans subconsciously know that eating a titan shifter will turn them back to normal.<br><br>

              <li><h2>Attack On Titan Is About WWII</h2></li><img src="images/aotwart.jfif" class="mini4"><br>Fans belive that attack on titan is an analogy of World War II. Reason being that many parts of the anime can be compared
              to the events that took place in attack on titan. For example, the elements of the anime parallel other pieces of literature centered around the bombing of Hiroshima
